# evipy

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/evipy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/evipy)
[![Python 3.12+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.12+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

A Python library for controlling Eviqo devices via cloud connection. Monitor your Eviqo charging stations and retrieve real-time data through WebSocket communication.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of Eviqo charging stations
- WebSocket-based communication with Eviqo cloud services
- Live widget updates and device status tracking
- Automatic session management and authentication
- Type-safe data models with Pydantic

## Installation

Install evipy from PyPI:

```bash
pip install evipy
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before using evipy, you need to set up your Eviqo credentials as environment variables:

```bash
export EVIQO_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
export EVIQO_PASSWORD="your-password"
```

Alternatively, create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```env
EVIQO_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
EVIQO_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### Running the Monitor

To start monitoring your Eviqo devices in real-time:

```bash
python -m evipy.evipy
```

This will:
1. Connect to the Eviqo cloud service
2. Authenticate using your credentials
3. Discover your devices
4. Display live updates from your charging stations

### Example Output

```
14:23:15 - evipy - login:195 - Found device name='Home Charger' deviceId=89349
14:23:16 - evipy - parse_widget_update:344 - {'widget_id': '5', 'widget_name': 'Charging Power', 'device_id': '89349', 'widget_value': '241.29'}
```
